## Algorithms and Data Structures
Implement the common algorithms and data structures and analysing its Time/ Space complexity. Try to find the optimal solution.

#### Algorithms
1. Binary Search

1. Tree
    1. Tree Traverse
    1. Binary Tree
    1. BST
1. Graph    
    1. Graph Traverse
        1. DFS
        1. BFS-1 (Breadth first search)
        1. BFS-2 (Best first search)
1. Recursion
    1. DFS
1. String
    1. Char Removal
        1. remove some particular chars from a string.
        1. remove all​ leading/trailing/duplicated​ empty spaces from a string.
    1. De-duplication
    1. SubString
        1. Optimal Solution
            * Rabin-Karp
            * KMP
    1. String Reversal
    1. String Replacement
    1. String Shuffling
    1. Permutation
    1. Encoding / Decoding
    1. Sliding Window
1. Bit Operations

    Can be solved by building blocks below

    * Get kth bit   =>   (x >> k) & 1
    * Set kth bit as 1  =>  x | (1 << k)
    * Set kth bit as 0  =>  x & (~(1 << k))
    
    



#### Data structures
1. Linked List
1. Stack
1. Queue
1. Deque
1. Heap(PriorityQueue)
1. HashMap

#### Interview Steps - CART
1. Clarification
    1. Object
        * Null
        * Empty
    1. Collection / Array
        * Sorted
            * Ascending
            * Descending
        * Unsorted
        * Duplicate
        * Contains target or not(search element)
    1. String
        * Leading, trailing spaces
        * in place or not
        * Duplicate Elements
1. Assumption
1. Result
1. Testing
